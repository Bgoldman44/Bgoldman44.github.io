             Hello, my name is Ben. I am a high school student, and I chose to make this site/app/whatever because, frankly, I have a horrible
             memory. I find that some html or css code is a bit hard to remeber, so I made this site as a quick reference sheet for anyone who
             cannot remeber how to make an image, or what type of tags make a list. I hope it's helpful for you! Note; I do not know much advanced
             stuff. Do not expect this site to tell you super advanced stuff. It will primarily be beginner stuff that is easily forgettable.
      </p>

      Also, if this site glitches out in any way, just blame your browser, not me.
