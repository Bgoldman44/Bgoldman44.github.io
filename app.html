      This app was created to be used as a quick, easy to navigate guide for html and css. It may not look nice, but I want it to load as
      quickly as possible. I often find myself forgetting simple things, like what tags make an ordered list versus an unordered one. So,
      this site is desinged to be a quick guide with commonly-forgotten stuff. If you cannot remeber the correct way to make an image or change
      the font size, then just check here. Please note, however, that I myself am still learning how to code with html and css, so a lot of the
      stuff here will be at beginer-level for now. Please do not expect to see any super advanced stuff here yet. This site will tell you how to
      change font color, not how to make a bloody search engine.
